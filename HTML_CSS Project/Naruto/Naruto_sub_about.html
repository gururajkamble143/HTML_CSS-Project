                <p class="par">Otaku (Japanese: おたく, オタク, or ヲタク) is a Japanese word that describes people with 
                    consuming interests, particularly in anime, manga, video games, or computers. Its contemporary use 
                    originated with a 1983 essay by Akio Nakamori in Manga Burikko. Otaku may be used as a pejorative 
                    with its negativity stemming from a stereotypical view of otaku as social outcasts and the media's 
                    reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, "The Otaku Murderer", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, 
                    the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now identify themselves as 
                    otaku,[1] both in Japan and elsewhere. Out of 137,734 teens surveyed in Japan in 2013, 42.2% 
                    self-identified as a type of otaku.
                    Otaku subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic 
                    research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of otaku 
                    traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to what was then seen as 
                    inevitably becoming social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, after the 
                    release of works such as Mobile Suit Gundam before it branched into Comic Market. The otaku 
                    subculture continued to grow with the expansion of the internet and media, as more anime, video games, 
                    shows, and comics were created.[2] The definition of otaku subsequently became more complex, and numerous 
                    classifications of otaku emerged.</p>
